# Game of life: JS/TS implementation

- utilised basic html cnvas with 2d context.
- very simple implementation
- no specific libraries utilised

## TO-DO

I think this is done basically for now. however, should I ever want to tinker in the future then the following can be picked up:

- Add more functionalities to the toolbar?
  - make it possible to go back certain steps
  - add a reset config button to go back to initial preset?
- Decide on a preset storage format
- Add more presets
